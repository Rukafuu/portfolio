**Lucas Frischeisen** — _Full Stack Developer & AI Engineer_

An interactive orbital ecosystem built with **Vanilla Three.js** and **React 19**. This is not just a portfolio, but a cinematic journey through a digital architecture, exploring technologies and projects as if they were celestial bodies.

## 🌑 The "Gargantua" Black Hole

The centerpiece of this project is a cinematic recreation of a black hole, inspired by _Interstellar_. Far from a standard implementation, this version uses **Layered Geometry** and **Custom Post-Processing** to achieve visual fidelity while maintaining 60FPS performance.

### Technical Deep Dive:

- **Shielded Event Horizon**: A core of absolute darkness (`#000000`) protected from scene fog, bloom, and tone mapping artifacts.
- **Accretion Disk & Halo**: Multi-layered geometric disks with ultra-high emissive intensity and procedural orbital animation.
- **Singularity Finality**: A proximity-based transition system that dynamically hides scene lighting and starfields as the camera enters the horizon, revealing the "void" interior.

---

## 🚀 Technological Core

Built with a focus on modern performance and immersive UX:

- **React Three Fiber & Drei**: Declarative abstraction for the Three.js ecosystem.
- **Three.js (r183)**: High-performance 3D engine.
- **Custom Post-Processing**: Selective Bloom, Chromatic Aberration, and Grain for a "space-comm" digital aesthetic.
- **Dynamic HUD**: Fully responsive UI built with **Framer Motion** and CSS Variables (`clamp`, `var(--tokens)`).
- **Internationalization**: Full support for English, Portuguese, Spanish, German, and Japanese via **i18next**.

## 📡 Mission Architecture (The Journey)

The user journey is orchestrated by a central **SolarJourneyController**, mapping technical sectors to orbital nodes:

1.  **The Sun (Nucleus)**: Interface initialization and technical tutorial.
2.  **Mercury & Venus**: Core Front-end Stack and Application Architecture.
3.  **Earth Flyby**: Global system overview and performance statistics.
4.  **Mars & Jupiter**: Back-end Infrastructure and AI/Cognitive Solutions.
5.  **Saturn (Creative Realms)**: Multimedia systems and synthetic audio engineering.
6.  **Uranus & Neptune**: Professional deployments and communication protocols.
7.  **Gargantua (The Finale)**: The crossing of the event horizon and journey conclusion.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

- **Reskyume_OS_v2.0**: A custom design system inspired by spacecraft telemetry systems.
- **Dynamic Responsive Scaling**: Fluid typography and grid systems that adapt from ultra-wide monitors to mobile devices.
- **Cinematic Transitions**: Smooth orbital camera paths managed via GSAP and state-based logic.
